# Change Log (Agent-Assisted Work)

A running record of code changes made during AI-agent-assisted work sessions,
with the reasoning behind each one. This is distinct from
[`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) at the repo root, which tracks user-facing
release notes per version. See [`docs/agent-reminders.md`](agent-reminders.md)
for the task/question log this change log is paired with.

### Fix: Invoice print action downloaded a local path that doesn't exist on production (500 error)

**Files:**
- `plugins/webkul/accounts/src/Filament/Resources/InvoiceResource/Actions/PreviewAction.php`

**Symptom:** `POST /livewire-70e0a63d/update` returned `500 Internal Server
Error` when clicking Print from the invoice Preview modal
(`/admin/invoices/customers/invoices/1`).

**Root cause:** The action saved the generated PDF through the `public`
filesystem disk (`Storage::disk('public')->put(...)`, inside
`Webkul\Support\Traits\PDFHandler::savePDF()`), but then tried to serve it
back with `response()->download(storage_path('app/public/'.$pdfPath))`.
`storage_path()` only ever resolves a path on the local filesystem. In
production, `FILESYSTEM_PUBLIC_DRIVER` is `tenant-s3` (see
`config/filesystems.php`), so the `public` disk actually writes to S3 — the
file never existed at that local path, and Symfony's `download()` threw a
`FileNotFoundException`, surfacing to the user as a generic Livewire 500.

**Fix:** Read the file back through the same disk it was written to, using
Laravel's disk-agnostic `download()` helper (streams via `readStream()` for
any adapter, not just local):

```php
// before
return response()->download(storage_path('app/public/'.$pdfPath));

// after
return Storage::disk('public')->download($pdfPath);
```

**Follow-up (not done, flagged only):** The same write-via-disk /
read-via-`storage_path()` mismatch exists in
`plugins/webkul/chatter/src/Traits/HasChatter.php::addAttachments()`
(~line 620), plus a related disk mismatch in `removeAttachment()` (uses the
default disk with a `'public/'` prefix instead of `Storage::disk('public')`).
Left untouched since it's a different feature (chatter attachments) than the
reported bug — worth a dedicated pass if attachment upload/removal is also
misbehaving in production.
